This is a Bash script designed to automate the installation, updating, and downgrading of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on Ubuntu-based systems. It leverages the GitHub API to check versions and provides a user-friendly interface for managing your VS Code installation.

## Features

- **Version Checking**: Compares your installed VS Code version with the latest release from GitHub.
- **Flexible Updates**: Choose to update to the latest version, reinstall the current version, or downgrade to a specific version.
- **Smart Downloading**: Checks if the required `.deb` file is already present before downloading, saving time and bandwidth.
- **Process Management**: Automatically detects and terminates running VS Code instances (gracefully or forcefully if needed) to ensure a smooth installation.
- **Interactive Prompts**: Offers clear choices for updating, downgrading, and cleanup with version information displayed.
- **Dependency Handling**: Fixes missing dependencies during installation if required.
- **Cleanup Control**: Asks before removing downloaded `.deb` files, allowing you to keep them if desired.
- **Verbose Output**: Provides detailed feedback at every step for transparency and troubleshooting.

## Supported Systems

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Other Debian-based systems (with `.deb` package support)

**Note**: This script is tailored for `.deb` packages (Debian/Ubuntu). Adjustments are needed for RPM-based or other systems.

## Prerequisites

- `bash`, `curl`, `wget`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk` (typically pre-installed on Ubuntu)
- `dpkg` and `apt-get` (for installation)
- `sudo` privileges
- Internet connection

## Installation and Usage

1. **Download the Script**:
   ```bash
   wget -O vscode-auto-updater.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanOfAllCodes/snippets-and-documentation/refs/heads/main/installer/vscode/vscode-auto-updater.sh
    ```
2. **Make it Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x vscode-auto-updater.sh
    ```
3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./vscode-auto-updater.sh
    ```
   - The script will guide you through the process with interactive prompts.

## How It Works

1. **Version Detection**:
   - Checks your installed VS Code version (or assumes `0.0.0` if not installed).
   - Queries the GitHub API (`microsoft/vscode`) for the latest release.

2. **User Choice**:
   - If versions match: Offers to reinstall or downgrade.
   - If a newer version exists: Offers to update, downgrade, or skip.
   - Options:
     - `y`: Install/reinstall the latest version.
     - `n`: Exit without changes.
     - `d`: Specify a custom version (e.g., `1.86.0`), validated against GitHub releases.

3. **Download and Install**:
   - Downloads the `.deb` file to the scriptâ€™s directory if not already present.
   - Closes any running VS Code instances.
   - Installs the `.deb` file with `dpkg`, fixing dependencies if needed.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Prompts to delete the downloaded `.deb` file or keep it.

## Example Output

```bash
Starting VS Code version check and update script...

```

## Limitations

- **Download Source**: Uses `code.visualstudio.com` for `.deb` files, which by default provides the latest version. Downgrading to a specific version requires `.deb` file sourcing (see below).
- **OS Specificity**: Designed for Ubuntu/Debian (`.deb`). Other systems need URL and installer adjustments.
- **GitHub API**: Subject to rate limits (60 requests/hour unauthenticated). Heavy use may require a token.

## Downgrading Note

The script fetches version-specific `.deb` files from `https://update.code.visualstudio.com/$SELECTED_VERSION/linux-deb-x64/stable` based on your selected version, enabling true downgrading to any release validated against GitHub. If a version is unavailable on the server, you may need to source the `.deb` manually and place it in the script directory.
